Perhaps the in-house employment and high-ranking position of Masliah caught their attention and obliged them to do something.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">113221041858017628</guid><pubDate>Sun, 29 Sep 2024 13:19:55 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Boris Barbour</title><link>https://mastodon.social/@BorisBarbour/113221043333628913</link><description>Nevertheless, a combination of PubPeer, an alert Charles Piller and a couple of volunteer analysts ran rings and looped loops around the NIH investigation, which only looked at 2 papers. Official investigations are crap, again.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">113221043333628913</guid><pubDate>Sun, 29 Sep 2024 13:20:17 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Boris Barbour</title><link>https://mastodon.social/@BorisBarbour/113221044467801687</link><description>Reading between the lines, it seems that NIH are scrambling to adjust to the new information they failed to investigate and were not planning a severe response, since Masliah was still representing the organisation this week. This remains to be clarified.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">113221044467801687</guid><pubDate>Sun, 29 Sep 2024 13:20:34 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Boris Barbour</title><link>https://mastodon.social/@BorisBarbour/113221045487490018</link><description>The levels of wasted human and financial resources, the potential corruption of science and its administration are significant. Masliah operated with impunity. NIH procedures are totally ineffective at detecting or deterring career-long, industrial-scale cheating.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">113221045487490018</guid><pubDate>Sun, 29 Sep 2024 13:20:50 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Boris Barbour</title><link>https://mastodon.social/@BorisBarbour/113221046504888724</link><description>In fact, convince me that NIH procedures don't in practice facilitate and encourage such cheating.

Conflicts of interest. I assume (but don't know) that Masliah wound up his lab upon taking the NIA job. But, without suggesting any specific transactions, it seems likely that Masliah's position might have influenced (negatively) desire to report his misconduct.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">113221048029847199</guid><pubDate>Sun, 29 Sep 2024 13:21:29 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Boris Barbour</title><link>https://mastodon.social/@BorisBarbour/113221049883056370</link><description>Similarly, the industry pursuit of multiple therapeutic strategies based upon his work could well have been influenced (positively) by his position.

NIH don't want to screen for misconduct when they hire people, because of the "difficulty of the process". I'm going to predict it would be a whole lot easier and more effective if they hired Mu Yang and Matthew Schrag (or several other analysts).</description><guid isPermaLink="false">113221053347330305</guid><pubDate>Sun, 29 Sep 2024 13:22:50 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Boris Barbour</title><link>https://mastodon.social/@BorisBarbour/113221054614577088</link><description>And, of course, there is a pile of public information on PubPeer just waiting to be "discovered" and acted upon by officialdom. As this affair shows, pulling on the thread of a couple of PubPeer comments sometimes (mixing my metaphors) opens a whole can of worms.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">113221054614577088</guid><pubDate>Sun, 29 Sep 2024 13:23:09 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Boris Barbour</title><link>https://mastodon.social/@BorisBarbour/113221055909514578</link><description>Science EiC Holden Thorp (who has a good record on dealing with misconduct) gave an unfortunately nonchalant quote about seeking a "response" from the authors and making "adjustments" to a paper if "required".</description><guid isPermaLink="false">113221055909514578</guid><pubDate>Sun, 29 Sep 2024 13:23:29 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Boris Barbour</title><link>https://mastodon.social/@BorisBarbour/113221057079796110</link><description>There is an alarmingly naive quote from a researcher in the field suggesting the synuclein antibody strategy might still be effective.
