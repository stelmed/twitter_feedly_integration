This remains to be clarified.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">113221044467801687</guid><pubDate>Sun, 29 Sep 2024 13:20:34 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Boris Barbour</title><link>https://mastodon.social/@BorisBarbour/113221045487490018</link><description>The levels of wasted human and financial resources, the potential corruption of science and its administration, are significant. Masliah operated with impunity.

Conflicts of interest. I assume (but don't know) that Masliah wound up his lab upon taking the NIA job. But, without suggesting any specific transactions, it seems likely that Masliah's position might have influenced (negatively) desire to report his misconduct.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">113221048029847199</guid><pubDate>Sun, 29 Sep 2024 13:21:29 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Boris Barbour</title><link>https://mastodon.social/@BorisBarbour/113221049883056370</link><description>Similarly, the industry pursuit of multiple therapeutic strategies based upon his work could well have been influenced (positively) by his position.
