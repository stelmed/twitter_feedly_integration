Gone are the days of stonewalling all such problems, and good riddance. Procedures can certainly be improved, though. Co-authors (students) had been kept out of the loop during the investigation, which they only discovered when asked if they agreed with the retraction. Obviously they should have been contacted as soon as the investigation began. /5</description><guid isPermaLink="false">112073902544510112</guid><pubDate>Sun, 10 Mar 2024 23:07:18 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Boris Barbour</title><link>https://mastodon.social/@BorisBarbour/112073904774601037</link><description>Incredibly, Nature then accepted another paper from Dias about a new superconducting material.EiC Magdalena Skipper: "Our editorial policy considers every submission in its own right”.
