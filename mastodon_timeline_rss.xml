For the innocent in the audience, to prove me wrong, you will need to check the original data. Good luck with that under NIH's risible 4-year retention rule!</description><guid isPermaLink="false">113221027048553418</guid><pubDate>Sun, 29 Sep 2024 13:16:09 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Boris Barbour</title><link>https://mastodon.social/@BorisBarbour/113221028136890736</link><description>First big question. How did nobody in a lab operating in this way for 26 years and producing 800 papers not raise an alert? If your data are altered, you notice. Were junior members systematically intimidated? Throughout their subsequent careers?</description><guid isPermaLink="false">113221028136890736</guid><pubDate>Sun, 29 Sep 2024 13:16:25 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Boris Barbour</title><link>https://mastodon.social/@BorisBarbour/113221029467287067</link><description>The so far uniformly positive views of his personality do not suggest a particularly toxic lab culture, but Masliah's uniquely powerful position may have enabled effective silencing. We'll probably soon find out if earlier alerts were buried.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">113221029467287067</guid><pubDate>Sun, 29 Sep 2024 13:16:46 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Boris Barbour</title><link>https://mastodon.social/@BorisBarbour/113221031217305165</link><description>Alternatively, did those junior members consider that behaviour normal?

This lab churned out untrustworthy research. Yet according to publication and citation data, as well as his appointment, the field basically elected him leader.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">113221032106875600</guid><pubDate>Sun, 29 Sep 2024 13:17:26 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Boris Barbour</title><link>https://mastodon.social/@BorisBarbour/113221033226467678</link><description>Did nobody in the field notice the work was unreliable? Is it possible that this unreliable work was no worse or maybe still better than most of the rest of the field's production?</description><guid isPermaLink="false">113221033226467678</guid><pubDate>Sun, 29 Sep 2024 13:17:43 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Boris Barbour</title><link>https://mastodon.social/@BorisBarbour/113221034171967780</link><description>Rather than neurodegeneration research progressively accumulating carefully validated research, this gives the impression of a field barely treading water in a swamp of untrustworthy results.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">113221034171967780</guid><pubDate>Sun, 29 Sep 2024 13:17:57 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Boris Barbour</title><link>https://mastodon.social/@BorisBarbour/113221035299918435</link><description>In this context, James Heather's recent estimate that 1/7 papers contains falsified or fabricated results suddenly seems very plausible. &lt;a href="https://osf.io/s4gce" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" translate="no"&gt;&lt;span class="invisible"&gt;https://&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=""&gt;osf.io/s4gce&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="invisible"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="false">113221035299918435</guid><pubDate>Sun, 29 Sep 2024 13:18:15 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Boris Barbour</title><link>https://mastodon.social/@BorisBarbour/113221036915613865</link><description>James also asked whether cheats might not be more prolific than honest researchers. And of course, like here, they are. Almost by definition, people cheat for speed.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">113221036915613865</guid><pubDate>Sun, 29 Sep 2024 13:18:39 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Boris Barbour</title><link>https://mastodon.social/@BorisBarbour/113221037997536629</link><description>Third big question.

Perhaps the in-house employment and high-ranking position of Masliah caught their attention and obliged them to do something.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">113221041858017628</guid><pubDate>Sun, 29 Sep 2024 13:19:55 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Boris Barbour</title><link>https://mastodon.social/@BorisBarbour/113221043333628913</link><description>Nevertheless, a combination of PubPeer, an alert Charles Piller and a couple of volunteer analysts ran rings and looped loops around the NIH investigation, which only looked at 2 papers. Official investigations are crap, again.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">113221043333628913</guid><pubDate>Sun, 29 Sep 2024 13:20:17 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Boris Barbour</title><link>https://mastodon.social/@BorisBarbour/113221044467801687</link><description>Reading between the lines, it seems that NIH are scrambling to adjust to the new information they failed to investigate and were not planning a severe response, since Masliah was still representing the organisation this week. This remains to be clarified.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">113221044467801687</guid><pubDate>Sun, 29 Sep 2024 13:20:34 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Boris Barbour</title><link>https://mastodon.social/@BorisBarbour/113221045487490018</link><description>The levels of wasted human and financial resources, the potential corruption of science and its administration, are significant. Masliah operated with impunity. NIH procedures are totally ineffective at detecting or deterring career-long, industrial-scale cheating.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">113221045487490018</guid><pubDate>Sun, 29 Sep 2024 13:20:50 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Boris Barbour</title><link>https://mastodon.social/@BorisBarbour/113221046504888724</link><description>In fact, Convince me that NIH procedures don't in practice facilitate and encourage such cheating. After all, they hired Masliah.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">113221046504888724</guid><pubDate>Sun, 29 Sep 2024 13:21:06 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Boris Barbour</title><link>https://mastodon.social/@BorisBarbour/113221048029847199</link><description>Fourth big question. Conflicts of interest. I assume (but don't know) that Masliah wound up his lab upon taking the NIA job. But, without assuming any specific transactions, it seems likely that Masliah's position might have influenced (negatively) desire to report his misconduct.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">113221048029847199</guid><pubDate>Sun, 29 Sep 2024 13:21:29 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Boris Barbour</title><link>https://mastodon.social/@BorisBarbour/113221049883056370</link><description>Similarly, the industry pursuit of multiple therapeutic strategies based upon his work could well have been influenced (positively) by his position.
