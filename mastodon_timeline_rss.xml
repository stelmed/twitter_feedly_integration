Le Guin in 2008:"Within the corporate whales are many luckless Jonahs who were swallowed alive with their old publishing house—editors and such anachronisms—people who read wide awake. Some of them are so alert they can scent out promising new writers. Some of them have their eyes so wide open they can even proofread. But it doesn’t do them much good. For years now, most editors have had to waste most of their time on an unlevel playing field, fighting Sales and Accounting."&lt;a href="https://harpers.org/archive/2008/02/staying-awake/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;span class="invisible"&gt;https://&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ellipsis"&gt;harpers.org/archive/2008/02/st&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="invisible"&gt;aying-awake/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="false">112072824362328772</guid><pubDate>Sun, 10 Mar 2024 18:33:06 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Molly White</title><link>https://hachyderm.io/@molly0xfff/112072629742255594</link><description>Despite his impressive journalism, "I never got health insurance for it.

Gone are the days of stonewalling all such problems, and good riddance. Procedures can certainly be improved, though. Co-authors (students) had been kept out of the loop during the investigation, which they only discovered when asked if they agreed with the retraction. Obviously they should have been contacted as soon as the investigation began. /5</description><guid isPermaLink="false">112073902544510112</guid><pubDate>Sun, 10 Mar 2024 23:07:18 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Boris Barbour</title><link>https://mastodon.social/@BorisBarbour/112073904774601037</link><description>Incredibly, Nature then accepted another paper from Dias about a new superconducting material.EiC Magdalena Skipper: "Our editorial policy considers every submission in its own right”.
