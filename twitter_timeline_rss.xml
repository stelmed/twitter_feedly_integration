      <title>On one of my first papers, it took three months to get those initial reviews. I remember wondering at the time why it could possibly take so long.

And then I worked as an editor for a while, and learned why, and how much it depends on us, the reviewers.

What do you do? Inviting yet another reviewer will also take at least two weeks, maybe more. So the editor agrees to extend the deadline.</title>

      <description>Now at nine weeks, the reviewer sends an email: something came up, and they need another two weeks before they can complete their review.

What do you do? Inviting yet another reviewer will also take at least two weeks, maybe more. So the editor agrees to extend the deadline.</description>

      <title>True to their word, the reviewer submits their review on time! It takes a few days to go over their review and consult with other editors, but finally, a decision is send to the author. 

But it took almost three months to get here.</title>

      <title>Could this have been done faster? Maybe. If you immediately drop a reviewer when they go past the deadline, you might save a week. But what if that reviewer was going to send their review the next day? 

By dropping them, you would have actually lost over two weeks.</title>

      <title>Realistically, the only way an editor could speed this up, is by not replacing a reviewer who dropped out. I sometimes did this, when the other reviewers covered a manuscript well enough, or if it was clear the manuscript should be rejected.

A long review process is a good sign!</title>

      <title>This isn't meant to blame and shame, merely to illustrate how much a manuscript can be delayed by a single reviewer not responding. How even hitting that "decline to review" button helps to speed up the process.

How an editor can do everything right, and still take months.</title>

      <title>Mind you, sometimes a delay really is just due to an editor forgetting to look at your manuscript. It has happened to me, and in such cases, it helps if authors enquire about their manuscript.

Don't hesitate to e-mail your editor if it has taken more than a month or two!</title>

      <title>A simple model showed that inactivation of A-type K+ channels opens the dSpike window, and inactivation of dendritic NaV channels shuts it.  These channels implement a high-pass filter on the spike rate: increasing spike rates lead to dSpikes, while constant spiking does not. https://t.co/ns6nhdI6JV</title>

      <title>Doyeon also did a careful analysis of the subcellular distribution of potentiated spines.  Most of the plasticity was in proximal basal and apical dendrites. https://t.co/sEr2PIKOzf</title>

      <title>There are also analyses of 'hot' vs 'cold' dendrites, and sub-dendrite clustering of synaptic plasticity.  We think that pulse-chase labeling with HT-GluA1 is a powerful tool for mapping synaptic plasticity.</title>

      <title>This is consistent with the view that distal apical inputs from entorhinal cortex act as a gate on plasticity of proximal inputs from CA3.</title>

      <title>A study in @NatureGenet identifies risk loci for spontaneous coronary artery dissection and implicates arterial integrity and tissue-mediated coagulation in the disease etiology. Several risk variants show opposite effects on coronary artery disease risk. https://t.co/zQC59ZGrHB https://t.co/ia1naGxGvh</title>
