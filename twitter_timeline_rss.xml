      <title>Senolytic compounds have shown promise for the treatment of aging-related diseases. A study in @NatureAging uses a deep learning model to identify compounds with favorable drug-like properties and confirms one compound’s in vivo activity in aged mice. 🔒 https://t.co/VSR9KkDPr4 https://t.co/YeR5CbiDZF</title>
