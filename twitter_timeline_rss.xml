Here's a little history/motivation on it too:

1/3) Long ago we did this fabulous paper from Surace et al. in JC: https://t.co/ZfZ3HIk4gO 

It lays out nicely the fact that gradient descent assumes a Euclidean distance function in synaptic weight space. https://t.co/p8rEBPgLrY</title>

      <title>Exactly.
Just because Auto-Regressive LLMs are not controllable doesn't mean that future AI system won't be controllable.
In fact, we've been focusing on Objective-Driven AI architectures in part *because* they are controllable, and also because they can reason and plan. https://t.co/IRB5L9KWYM</title>
