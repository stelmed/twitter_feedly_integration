      <title>How does #SARSCoV2 infect #macrophages? 

A new @SciSignal study shows the virus enters both ACE2-expressing and -deficient macrophages, but replicates and triggers antiviral responses only in ACE2-expressing cells. https://t.co/Zj0XhRthM5 https://t.co/TO7dOvWKxz</title>

      <title>The strength of CEBRA is the flexibility &amp;amp; performance: no generative model = no restrictions on data, &amp;amp; it can be used unsupervised (Time) or w/labels (Behavior).

Here, we demo on hippocampus with CEBRA-Time and then do hypo. testing for a quantitative readout of model fit! https://t.co/3E6r3b8F91</title>

I have no doubt that superhuman AI systems will eventually exist.

But today they don't, and we don't even have a basic design for them.

That's a common counter-example of @geoffreyhinton's claim that more intelligent things almost always control less intelligent things. https://t.co/sjcs2tXtTr</title>

We can design AI to have superhuman intelligence *and* be submissive.

I always wonder why people just assume that intelligent entities will necessarily want to dominate.
That's just plain false, even within the human species.</title>
