      <title>Worrying about superhuman AI alignment today is like worrying turbojet engine safety in 1920.

We do not have a working design for anything that could come close to becoming as smart as a dog, let alone a domestic robot that can clear the dinner table &amp;amp; fill up the dishwasher.</title>

      <title>And the idea that intelligent systems will inevitably want to take over, dominate humans, or just destroy humanity through negligence is preposterous.
They would have to be specifically designed to do so.
Whereas we will obviously design them to not do so.</title>

      <title>Making AI safe is going to happen as with every new technology (e.g. cars, airplanes, etc): it's going to be a process of iterative refinement.

And again, getting that slightly wrong may hurt some people (as cars and airplanes have) but will not wipe out humanity.</title>

But making it sound like it's an unsolvable problem is, at the very least, extremely premature, and most likely just false.</title>

      <title>But regardless, until we have a semi credible design, we are discussing the sex of angels.

The worst that can happen is that we won't figure out a good way to make them safe and we won't deploy them.

Sort of like nuclear-powered cars and rockets that were promised in the 1950s</title>

It's Buster Keaton’s “The General” (1926) and had a total budget of today's $595,000.

It was filmed in a single take with a real train and a ‘dummy’ engineer https://t.co/uNqbt1zp7q
