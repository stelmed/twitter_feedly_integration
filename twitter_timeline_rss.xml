      <title>Pushed a big update to this : https://t.co/Qyt4nVo3es
Introduces a local database to handle large number of papers and have stats, summaries and embeddings saved to limit API calls. I needed this to go toward making reviews. Some test coverage but your mileage may vary.</title>

      <title>Lottery seems deeply unfair too. Utility maximization for them would be to give it to the person who most cares. Welfare maximization for science would be to give it to the person who will (over their career) most benefit from working with me. Either is hard to assess.</title>
