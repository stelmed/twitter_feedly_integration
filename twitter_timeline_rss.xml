      <title>In the world of animal models, naked mole rats are the supermodels. They rarely get cancer, are resistant to some types of pain, and can survive up to 18 minutes without oxygen. But perhaps their greatest feat, a new paper suggests, is that they don't age https://t.co/D4n1bXuNBR https://t.co/sAO3r46OUW</title>

In my opinion, no amount of fine tuning will ever fix that.
It will require a redesign.

      <title>Updated version of new work by @kt_ferguson and several other lab folks! Cortical VIP cells aren't just for disinhibition or state-dependent modulation, they also regulate size tuning and have a context-dependent role in visual perception. 🔬🐭🧠https://t.co/a5vlXWh0cB</title>
