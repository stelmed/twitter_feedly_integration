      <title>New pooled library!  🎉
The pCMV-Rep78/68 scanning saturation mutagenesis library contains all possible single codon mutations of the AAV2 rep gene. It can be used to study the effects of rep mutations on production of a wide range of AAV capsid serotypes.

      <title>Elevated anxiety often precedes anorexia nervosa. Patients with anorexia nervosa often describe hunger as pleasant, potentially because food restriction can be anxiolytic. We tested whether chronic stress can cause animals to prefer a starvation-like state.

      <title>Here, we asked whether area V4, a mid-level area of the macaque visual system, is organized into functional columns. We presented grayscale natural images &amp;amp; recorded responses of &amp;gt;1200 single V4 neurons in 100 electrophysiological recording sessions using 32-channel depth probes https://t.co/JGjN7K5AFE</title>
