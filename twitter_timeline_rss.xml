      <title>Our bio-plausible model (Plastic Caching) explains existing data slightly better than an abstract model of mental time travel (Planning-By-Replay), and lesioning
shows that its three major components (plasticity, episodic-like memory, and motivational control) are necessary.

      <title>Future experiments are needed to clearly disambiguate the Plastic Caching and the Mental-Time Travel hypothesis. We suggest one concrete experiment with testable predictions, as an example of how our framework allows designing new experiments.

It shows:

-  400 year perpetual calendar
- equation of time
- sidereal time
- Sun/Moon rise &amp;amp; set
- Moon's phase &amp;amp; age
- tides
- solar/lunar eclipses
- planisphere
- tellurium
- a full-featured orrery to Saturn moons
