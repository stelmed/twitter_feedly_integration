      <title>2️⃣ At @Google, a system called Borg helps data centres manage billions of tasks, from delivering search results to processing datasets.

Our AlphaZero model found new ways to better plan these workloads and optimise how hardware is used - meaning more internet for less energy. https://t.co/9xzPRq1PLb</title>

It was able to reduce the bitrate by 4%, without compromising on visual quality - so you can stream more content even on a slower connection. https://t.co/NOq3uY3rJm https://t.co/lCrgTjDxAS</title>

      <title>DBS might then try to sneak in a face-saving post-hoc commentary to the journal, arguing why the replication was flawed &amp;amp; should be ignored.

Fortunately, science (in my field at least) is becoming better at preventing this tactic by DBS's. Perhaps politics will get there too.</title>
