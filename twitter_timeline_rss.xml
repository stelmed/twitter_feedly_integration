      <title>My pet peeve on weather apps: What does "50% chance of rain" mean? 

Does it mean:

(A) 50% chance it will rain at some point (for maybe an hour) at some point during the day (like a passing thunderstorm)?

(B) 50% chance it will rain all day?

These are pretty different https://t.co/Ve9I32niMY</title>

      <title>@tyrell_turing OK, but the weather forecasters know which it is, ie they know whether there is a 50% chance that a hypothetical hurricane is about to dump 12 hours of rain on us, right? 

The issue is that the app doesnt have a good way to express correlations in the hour-by-hour prediction</title>

      <title>@TonyZador Precipitation probability is one of those crazy norms. It’s basically the forecaster’s certainty that precipitation will form or move into the area weighted by areal coverage of precipitation that is expected.

      <title>This is sadly super common. My advice to anyone *hoping* to attend any conference: apply for a visa before you even know if you'll go!

If you're a trainee, ask your supervisor if they can cover the cost of the visa even in the event you can't go (e.g. your poster is rejected). https://t.co/gGby8Lulab</title>

(ok, maybe over this last winter it might have been a bit more useful)</title>

I'm certainly less fluent in English than a 13B-parameter auto-regressive LLM.
(I wanted to say "a two-bit 13B LLM", but that might have been misinterpreted).
I'm hoping I don't confabulate as much though. https://t.co/UJH6dtjGGS</title>

      <title>Today is #WorldBeeDay! 

Almost 75% of our world’s crops depend on 🐝 and other pollinators. 

Find out how Abdelahid Bendahmane @INRAE_France is investigating how to make cultivated 🌼 &amp;amp; 🌿 more attractive to bees (and more sustainable!).

The sum of the squares of the first Fibonacci numbers up to  Fₙ  is the product of the nth and (n+1)th Fibonacci numbers.

F₀² + F₁² + ... + Fₙ²   =   FₙFₙ₊₁
