      <title>@KordingLab @ISDedal @OpenAI The question for us is: does *me* buying a product tend to make that company do more or less bad things.  My guess is: it makes them do more of what they were doing that led them to get me as a customer.  So, if that was bad, then I'm increasing the likelihood of them doing more.</title>
