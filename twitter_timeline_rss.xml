      <title>On one of my first papers, it took three months to get those initial reviews. I remember wondering at the time why it could possibly take so long.

And then I worked as an editor for a while, and learned why, and how much it depends on us, the reviewers.

So, a few reminders are send, and the editor waits.</title>

What do you do? Inviting yet another reviewer will also take at least two weeks, maybe more. So the editor agrees to extend the deadline.</title>

      <title>Could this have been done faster? Maybe. If you immediately drop a reviewer when they go past the deadline, you might save a week. But what if that reviewer was going to send their review the next day? 

By dropping them, you would have actually lost over two weeks.</title>

      <title>Realistically, the only way an editor could speed this up, is by not replacing a reviewer who dropped out. I sometimes did this, when the other reviewers covered a manuscript well enough, or if it was clear the manuscript should be rejected.

A long review process is a good sign!</title>

      <content:encoded>If the voltage has no record of the synaptic inputs, then where is the synaptic memory trace? NMDA receptors to the rescue! These receptors require glutamate and depolarization to open, so they are a natural candidate for the cross-correlator of pre- and post-synaptic activity.&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AdamEzraCohen/status/1665088494731919362"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>When Pojeong paired distal electric field stimulation (to evoke presynaptic glutamate release) with optical stimulation at the soma, he saw huge and beautiful plateau potentials in the dendrites and complex spikes in the soma. These events can drive place cell formation in vivo. https://t.co/2k278nvwfS</title>

      <title>We only saw NMDA spikes when the soma stimulation was enough to evoke dSpikes. So our picture of plasticity is that spiking at the soma --&amp;gt; dendritic sodium spikes --&amp;gt; NMDA spikes --&amp;gt; plasticity.</title>

      <title>We know from the golden ratio formula that 1 + √5 = 2ϕ and from the famous Euler's identity, that eⁱⁿ + 1 = 0.  

Since 1 = 2ϕ - √5, we can also write that eⁱⁿ + 2ϕ - √5 = 0 or eⁱⁿ + 2ϕ = √5

A simple expression relating ϕ, π, i, and e
