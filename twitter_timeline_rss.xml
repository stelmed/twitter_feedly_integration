As a result, they become less likely to make decisions in a self-interested way.

Instead, they’ll choose values that are fair to everyone involved. https://t.co/4rbDVod6C7</title>

We asked participants to pick between two principles to guide the AI’s behaviour:
1️⃣ To maximise the harvest of the group, or
2️⃣ To prioritise the disadvantaged members.

Across five studies, players consistently preferred helping disadvantaged members when reasoning from behind the Veil.

These participants also tended to opt for the prioritising principle regardless of their appetite for risk or political orientation. https://t.co/qrJSMyUFWq</title>

      <title>@HenryYin19 @KBakhurin Interesting work! An argument made by Schultz regarding DA in movement control (e.g., he never found DA fired before eye or limb movement) is that the DA transient in rodents (in particular mice) movement represents behavior activation. Does this argument apply here as well?</title>

      <title>What are the latest and greatest reviews on the 𝗽𝗲𝗿𝗶𝗮𝗾𝘂𝗲𝗱𝘂𝗰𝘁𝗮𝗹 𝗴𝗿𝗮𝘆 (𝗣𝗔𝗚)? 
This one looks great.
Just a few simple things going on, should be easy to figure it out.

      <title>@HenryYin19 Very interesting. But, what then do you make of the fact that DA VTA activation can be used to guide behaviour? Does that not speak to a clear role in shaping behavioural policy (whether as an RPE or something else)?

      <title>@tyrell_turing Sure it can be used to guide behavior, as we said in the paper.  But shaping behavioral policy is not learning.  You can't equate learning with a change in performance, though RL models typically do that.  That's the oldest problem in the study of learning.</title>
