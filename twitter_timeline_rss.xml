      <title>As an editor I understand this frustration but it's completely misdirected. Most academics are worked to the bone, so if they’re not reviewing they’re doing something else. Teaching 7 modules. Mentoring. Outreach. A simple 'quid pro quo' model of peer review fails to capture this https://t.co/DewIaD1mcR</title>

Use @PeerCommunityIn as a single hub for reviewing preprints, then let journals bid on the outcomes. https://t.co/ptFiWbQNnF

      <title>@KordingLab @Plinz @opherdonchin @jjodx It's also worth noting that decades of evidence have supported a role for synaptic changes in learning and memory. Though there some people like to pretend this question is up for grabs, it really isn't: we really do know that learning rests, in part, on synaptic changes.</title>

      <title>@KordingLab @Plinz @opherdonchin @jjodx Agreed. To answer your questions @Plinz:

1. No, not all learning is purely synaptic (there are also changes in, e.g., cell excitability).

2. There may be learning that doesn't rely on small synaptic changes, but we know at least some learning relies on this.</title>

      <title>@KordingLab @Plinz @opherdonchin @jjodx Another possible source of learning is "in-context" learning via activity dynamics, which I suspect underlies most learning during the day.

      <title>In this mesmerizing video by @CollmanForrest from our #ElectronMicroscopy team, a layer 5 thin tufted neuron is revealed with blue dendrites and purple axon. As it progresses, we zoom into where the neuron connects to a pyramidal cell.

- 1E19 insects at 1E5 neurons per insect = 1E24 insect neurons.
- 1E10 humans at 1E11 neurons per human = 1E21 human neurons.
Insects "outsmart" us by a factor of 1000. But I'm not particularly worried.</title>

      <title>Hey @tegmark, most of us know that super-intelligent machines of the future will have to aligned with human values.
We just don't think it's as difficult as you make it to be.
And we don't think that getting it slightly wrong merely once will spell doom on humanity. https://t.co/3tAS5wOLY8</title>

      <title>Worrying about superhuman AI alignment today is like worrying turbojet engine safety in 1920.

We do not have a working design for anything that could come close to becoming as smart as a dog, let alone a domestic robot that can clear the dinner table &amp;amp; fill up the dishwasher.</title>

They would have to be specifically designed to do so.
Whereas we will obviously design them to not do so.</title>

And again, getting that slightly wrong may hurt some people (as cars and airplanes have) but will not wipe out humanity.</title>

The worst that can happen is that we won't figure out a good way to make them safe and we won't deploy them.

Sort of like nuclear-powered cars and rockets that were promised in the 1950s</title>

      <title>The single most expensive scene shot in silent film history.

It's Buster Keaton’s “The General” (1926) and had a total budget of today's $595,000.

It was filmed in a single take with a real train and a ‘dummy’ engineer https://t.co/uNqbt1zp7q
