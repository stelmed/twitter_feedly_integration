      <title>@JonRWhitlock @bartulem @tucetombaz @ClaudiaBattist7 @Jingyi_GF @adric_dunn @KISNeuro Nice work!

@GordonPetty3 and I also saw movement-related signals in different thalamic nuclei that were independent of motor cortex and colliculus (https://t.co/09hr0irR6h). It would be interesting to try to decode a large set of movements from thalamic activity.</title>

      <title>@paqio I would expect broadening to be the same for both PSF sizes, kind of an additive effect. E.g., if the broading by scattering is 5 um, FWHMs could be 13 and 24 um - the relative broadening would be stronger for the smaller PSF. But I have no data on that, it's just my intuition.</title>

      <title>Surprisingly, the block prior was represented by few neurons in very few regions. To investigate this further, we devoted a whole companion paper to it, where additional analyses discovered widespread representations of the prior. (7/8)

      <title>So grateful for the outpouring of good wishes following my tweet about #breastcancer last week. Update: I'm home &amp;amp; recovering well! I hoped to read some relevant #poetry during this time but found few poems on how to ponder the risks &amp;amp; realities of cancer. So I wrote my own: https://t.co/38QbdpH9df</title>
