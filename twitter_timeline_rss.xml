      <description>Normally, the Atacama Desert in Chile, receives less than 12 mm of rain a year. However in the years when rainfall is unusually high, between September and November, this can happen. It's called ¬´desierto florido¬ª

      <title>@jianing1962 @KBakhurin Not sure what 'behavioral activation' means. I assume the animal is always 'activated' when alive. Schultz tried to determine the relationship between DA activity and movement at first, but he used mainly arm EMG measures which are not really appropriate here.</title>

      <title>@tyrell_turing Sure it can be used to guide behavior, as we said in the paper.  But shaping behavioral policy is not learning.  You can't equate learning with a change in performance, though RL models typically do that.  That's the oldest problem in the study of learning.</title>

      <title>@HenryYin19 This is all very interesting, thanks! But, I don't get this last claim. I would argue that learning is, by definition, a lasting improvement in performance. If DA stimulation leads to lasting changes in policy, then I think it is clearly some form of reinforcement signal.</title>
