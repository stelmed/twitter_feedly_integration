      <title>An update on my current activities is getting embarrassingly long overdue, and tie-friday is as good an opportunity as any, so: I am back in #science!

Very happy to have joined the lab of @koen_vervaeke at the @UniOslo, where this old slice patcher is finally learning imaging! https://t.co/QKF5AWrrpS</title>

      <title>I am incredibly grateful to @Vetenskapsradet and @EMBO for supporting me with an international postdoc fellowship, and @StratNeuro for acting as my home institute in Sweden.

I will be using in vivo voltage imaging to study plasticity in the retrosplenial cortex, exciting stuff!</title>

      <title>As for why I switched: while I really enjoyed working as an editor, I missed Scandinavia, and, more importantly, @Josje_vLunteren.

Berlin wasn't the place for me, but I had an amazing time working for @NatureComms, and can highly recommend it to everyone: you'll learn a ton!</title>

      <title>This paper convinced me to switch to methodology-based language when describing tasks/stimuli. Examples may be most stark in attention (calling a stimulus "attended" when all we can really say is it is "task-relevant"), but it applies to other topics too https://t.co/vE2JirQZhi https://t.co/m6pzUioTbJ</title>
